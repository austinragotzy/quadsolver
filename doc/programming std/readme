programing standart is:
	gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c11 "file name.c" -g -o "compiled file name"

spike and module of code needs a makefile with one word commands that are discriptive of what they do

each folder that has something in it needs a readme to describe whats going on and if its a spike explain your findings

all code should commented and spikes should be even more commented
