here i brought some stuff i found on the internet about the max and min of int, float, and double.

float:
The maximum value of float = 3.4028234664e+38
The minimum value of float = 1.1754943508e-38

floats do not overflow and start over when they get to a limit like integers do

int:
INT_MIN    = -2147483648
INT_MAX    = +2147483647
UINT_MAX   = 4294967295

and when they go past the limit for signed they flip signs and keep going and for unsigned they go back to zero and keep going
